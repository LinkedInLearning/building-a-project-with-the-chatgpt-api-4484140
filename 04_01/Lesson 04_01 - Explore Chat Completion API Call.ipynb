Light or Extra Light Olive Oil: These types of olive oils have a higher smoke point and milder flavor compared to regular or extra virgin olive oil.\\n\\n2. Pure Olive Oil: This type of olive oil is a blend of refined and virgin/extra virgin olive oils, making it more suitable for high-heat cooking like frying.\\n\\n3. Pomace Olive Oil: It is made by extracting the remaining oil from the pomace (olive pulp) after pressing olives for extra virgin or virgin olive oils. Pomace oil has a higher smoke point due to its refining process, making it good for deep-frying.\\n\\nIt's important to note that while these options work well for frying due to their higher smoke points, they may lack some of the flavors found in extra-virgin or cold-pressed varieties which are better suited for dressings and low-heat cooking methods like saut√©ing.\\n\",\n",
